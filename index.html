                <p class="mbr-text align-center display-5 pb-3 mbr-fonts-style"></p><p>Dear reader,</p><p>    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout history, during times of turmoil, visual arts has been utilized in many forms. Whether it has been to depict tragedy, strengthen nationalism in a country, or to promote peace, the visual arts have been a valuable medium of expression because it is a universal language. Unlike other art forms, comprehending visual arts does not require the ability to read or write. This enables people from various countries, economic backgrounds and levels of education to have the ability to comprehend the same piece of artwork. This is of importance because it allows like minded people to come together during times of crisis and bring about change.</p><p>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual arts reflect the thought process of the artist. By analyzing the connection between various visual art movements to economic and political crises throughout the same time period, it is possible to comprehend in depth important historical events. Visual arts created during monumental events such as: the Vietnam War, the African American Civil Rights Movement, the AIDS crisis, the Mexican Revolution, the Syrian Crisis and the Spanish Civil War will be analyzed in this project.</p><p>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to research this topic because of my connection to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. My mother is from Venezuela and I was born there 17 years ago. I had to leave at 9 months old because of the violence that developed during the presidency of Hugo Chavez. Currently, Venezuela is experiencing an economic and political crisis. I wanted to gain insight about the effects that economic and political crises have on a country and ways that its citizens come together to bring about change.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The repentant of this multi-genre research project is this website which is an art blog titled, "The Art Room" in which I will be analyzing the relationship between art and conflict through the creation of 5 different artifacts. The first artifact is an analysis of five different art pieces created in response to various conflicts, the Vietnam War, the African American Civil Rights Movement, the AIDS crisis, the Mexican Revolution, and the Spanish Civil War. The second artifact is a piece of art I created in response to the presidency of Francisco Madero during the Mexican Revolution titled, "Broken Promises". The third artifact is a critique of a work of art created during the Syrain Crisis titled, " We Are Not Numbers", by Heba Al Akkad. The fourth artifact is a poem inspired by an art piece created during the Syrian Crisis titled, "Cuffs" by Rabee Kiwan. The final artifact is a photograph I took in response to the Venezuelan crisis, titled "Family Reunion". These artifacts are reflections that give insight about the research question, “How have economic and political crisis affected visual arts throughout history?”.</p><p></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">The Mexican revolution started in 1910 with a call to arms by revolutionary leader Francisco Madero, against the corrupt president Porfirio Diaz. During the Mexican Revolution there was an explosion of art. This art was created to bring people together and highlight the injustices that the Mexican people were facing such as political corruption, extreme poverty, and classism. Many artists arose during this time period such as Jose Orozco, Diego Rivera and David Siquieros. These artists were known as the "Los Tres Grandes", "The Big Three". The mural below was painted by Diego Rivera and is titled, "The History of Mexico" which was started in  1929, 9 years after the end of the Mexican Revolution. In it there are monumental events that form part of Mexico's history. <br><br>Towards the bottom the conflict between the Aztecs and the Spaniards is depicted. There are also many religious allusions in this piece which symbolize the power that the Catholic Church had over the Mexican people. In the middle left of the image one can see a priest holding a bible. To the far right of that one can see a priest baptizing a young man. <br><br>The top portion of the mural represents the "Mexican Revolution". The men in suits which symbolize political figures are placed towards the top of the mural, meanwhile the peasants are located on the bottom. This represents the class divisions that existed in Mexico during the Revolution. Many important revolutionaries can also be seen throughout the mural. Emiliano Zapata who created the "Plan de Ayala",  a document that focused heavily on land reform can be seen in the middle panel towards the top of the mural holding a banner that reads, "Tierra y Libertad", "Land and Freedom". Revolutionary Pancho Villa, who was known for using guerilla war tactics during the revolution is also seen in the mural in the 1st panel to the right.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">During the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s visual arts were used as a medium to bring awareness of the dangers of the disease. One of the most significant artists during the AIDS crisis was Kieth Haring. Haring was diagnosed with AIDS in 1988. In 1989, he established the Keith Haring Foundation, which provided funding and imagery to AIDS organizations. Haring created caricatures to spread awareness of the disease. <br><br>The art piece featured below was created in 1989 by Kieth Haring. The title is, Silence = Death. The pink triangle featured in the image was a popular symbol during the AIDS crisis and was adapted by the activist group, Act Up. In the past, the pink triangle was used in Nazi Germany to label homosexuals in concentration camps as an act of humiliation. Actvist Lary Kramer believed that there was a parallel between the AIDS crisis and the Holacaust. In his book, "Reports from the Holocaust: the Story of an AIDS Activist", he argued that the epidemic should be regarded as a holocaust because of "the deaths that came directly from negligence of the government", similar to the deaths that occured during the Holocaust. Because of this comparison, many activists used the pink triangle. Instead of being used as a painful reminder of the past, the triangle was used as a symbol of survival and reistance during the AIDS crisis. The people in the visual represent society and their gestures of terror can symbolize the tragedy that will ensue if people remain silent.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">The Spanish Civil War occurred between the years 1936 until the year 1939. It was an armed conflict between the Republicans, and the Nationalists led by General Francisco Franco and resulted in 500,000 casualties. One of the most prominent artists of this period was Pablo Picasso. The art piece featured below is titled Guernica and was created in 1937. Guernica is a town in the province of Biscay in Basque Country. During the Spanish Civil War, it was recognized as a resistance to the movement and the epicenter of Basque culture, which added to its significance as a target. <br>    <br>On Monday, the 26th of April 1937, the Spanish Nationalist government had its allies, the Nazis, bombed the town of Guernica. This piece depicts the tragedies of warfare in Spain. There is a variety of symbols featured in this piece. The dull colors represent the tragedy of the innocent deaths. This creates a mood of melancholy. The horse and the bull seen in the painting symbolize the battle between the Republican fighters and Nationalists in Spain. The light bulb seen at the top of the painting is a small symbol of hope in between all of the chaos. The small flower placed by the hoof of the horse demonstrates the destruction of beauty and of innocent people. The petrified facial expressions seen on the faces of the animals and people depict the chaos that ensued during the bombing. Lastly, the broken sword seen towards the bottom of the image represents the dangers of violence.</p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">The Vietnam War started in the year 1955 and continued into the year 1975. The war was fought between the communist North Vietnam and non-communist  South Vietnam. This conflict occured during the Cold War, a period in which the United States fought wars to stop the spread of communism. In 1965 the U.S sent troops to support the anti-communist south Vietnam. <br><br>Art produced during this time period was used to highlight the tragedy of war. Some of the art focued on the responsibility of the U.S government in this violent conflict. This art piece is an etching created by James Gong Fu Dong in 1969 titled, <em>Vietnam Scoreboard.</em> Scoreboard in this context refers to a board that displays the number of casualties that took place. This piece presents a very critical view of the United States government. The man in pink that is flying a plane symbolizes the U.S. The family painted in green and black symbolizes the people of Vietnam. <br><br>This piece appeals to the audiences emotions through the inclusion of an innocent family. The juxtaposition of color between the two images emphasizes the tension between the two countries. The family is painted in black to symbolize the death and destruction of the Vietnamese people. The man is painted in pink, a color that creates a postive connotation, and is smiling. This symbolizes the arrogance of the U.S government and its disregard for the loss of Vietnamese lives.&nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-5">The African American Civil Rights movement was the period between 1954 and 1968. Visual art during this time period played an instrumental role in spreading awarness of the discrimination African Americans faced, boosting African American morale and bringing activists together. <br><br>The piece below was painted by Norman Rockwell in 1967 and is titled, New Kids in the Neighborhood. The painting illustrates the integration of an African American family into a predominatly white suburb in Chicago. Although the 1964 Civil Rights act had already been passed which prohibited discimantion in public places and worked to end dejure segregation, during the late 60s, African Americans in northern cities such as Chicago continued to face rampant economic discrimination.<br><br> Segregation by law was illegal. However, schools and neighborhoods were segregated through defacto segregation, segregation by practice. There were "white" and "black" neighborhoods which resulted in "white" and "black" schools. The painting demonstrates the tension between whites and blacks during this time period. The children can be seen as symbols of hope that one day unity will occur and they will all happily play together.  However in the background of the image one can see a small opening of a curtain. Behind it stands a figure. This can symbolize the resitance of people towards segregation.&nbsp;</p>

Pictured in the middle of the photo is Francisco Madero. The photo is titled "Broken Promises" because of the issues he failed to adress in his "Plan de San Luis Potosi". Many were angered with him such as Revolutionary&nbsp;Emiliano Zapata who criticized him for this in his "Plan de Ayala". &nbsp;<br><br>The broken mirror in this photo symbolizes the broken promises of Francisco Madero. The red of the flowers represents the bloodshed that occured during the "10 Tragic Days", which was a revolt that occured in Mexico City against Madero and ended with his assasination. The flowers symbolize how the broken promises during his presidency ultimately led to the revolt which resulted in his death.&nbsp;<br></div>

Akkad wanted to bring attention to the innocent lives affected by the war. Akkad created childlike drawings and scattered them thoughout the collage to symbolize the Syrian children. Through this piece Akkad wanted to convey that children are not part of the war and that their innocence must be protected. <br><br>The purpose behind the title of Akkad's piece is to emphasize that the statistics people see about the deaths of people in Syria represent real people with real lives, so their deaths should be respected and taken seriously. The red tones in this photo symbolize violence and destruction. The drawings of the children symbolize hope for the future that one day things will be better. Lastly, the figure in the middle covered in red drops symbolizes the lives taken during the crisis. &nbsp;</p>

This art piece is titled "Cuffs" by Rabee Kiwan and it was created in response to the Syrian Crisis. Kiwan describes the cuffs as a symbol of the lack of freedom in Syria. Kiwan also states that each cuff represents a human being. Creating this artifact allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the Syrian Crisis. &nbsp;</div>

Currently, it is very hard to communicate with my family in Venezuela because they are suffering from problems with their internet and constant power outages. Additionally, Venezuela is on the travel ban list so my family can not visit the United States and it also extremely difficult for us to visit Venezuela.&nbsp;<br><br>This is a photo of my mom. The purpose of the photo is to emphasize the difficulties of communication. The title of the photo is "Family Reunion". However, because it is too hard for our family members to visit, they are not able to make it to the reunion. Instead they are attending as a picture frame.&nbsp;</div>
